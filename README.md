#[color=#FFFFFF]What is DPSMate?[/color]#
DPSMate is not only a meter which shows numbers of the raid, such as damage done, damage taken, dispells etc., it is moreover an analyzing tool to review the raid or the previous fight as accurately as possible. This data can help to improve the gameplay or to judge better over someones performance.

#[b]Download and install:[/b]# (only english clients)
1. Download the addon folder [url=https://bitbucket.org/tomdy/dpsmate/downloads]here.[/url]
2. Rename the folder to "DPSMate"
3. I recommend to increase the addon memory to 150 mb.
4. Remove DPSMate.lua and DPSMate.lua.bak in your WTF/Account/YOUR ACC NAME/Kronos/YOUR CHAR NAME/SavedVariables/ (if you had DPSMate installed before)
5. I recommend to disable SW_Stats.
